<b> ROLES </b>
  <p>
   Once you are in the osTicket helpdesk portal you next want to define the roles. We are going to create a role called "Supreme Admin" and define what permissions that role will have.
    <p>
      
- We will go to Admin panel, Agent, and then Roles. Here is where we will add a new role.
      
- Name the role "Supreme Admin" or whatever you would like and assign all of the permissions to this role.
  
- To finish select "Add Role" at the bottom of your screen

<b> DEPARTMENTS </b>
<p>
 Tickets are filtered through departments so we must set up at least one for our enviroment.
 <p>

 - We will go to Admin panel, Agents, and then Departments. Here we will add a new department.

 - We will name this Department " System Admin", We have not created any "SLAs" so we will leave this as defaultfor now.

 - Now select create department at the bottom of the screen
